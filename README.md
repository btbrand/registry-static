registry-static(1) -- a flat-file registry mirror tool
======================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

    registry-static -d my.registry.com -o /var/www/registry

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module follows the `skimdb` from npm and creates a flat file copy of the
registry on your local machine. This can then be served up behind `nginx` to
give you a local, read-only mirror of the npm registry. It's not a private registry
nor does it attempt to be one. It's designed to allow you to use the registry
in-network to speed up your local development.

USAGE
-----

This is the most common use, this will start following the registry
and make copies of the modules and their tarballs into `/var/www/registry`.
When it does, it will replace the `tarball` key in the `package.json`
with the url provided with `-d` (so the downloads resolve locally).

This module also uses the sequence file, so you can kill it and it should
restart from where it left off.

_WARNING: This may take quite a while to complete and a large amount of disk space (more than 283GB at last check)_

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

When it pulls the `package.json` for a module, it will create a directory structure similar to this:

    ./davargs
    |-- -
    |   |-- davargs-0.0.1.tgz
    |   +-- davargs-0.0.2.tgz
    |-- 0.0.1
    |   +-- index.json
    |-- 0.0.2
    |   +-- index.json
    |-- index.json
    +-- latest
        +-- index.json

This allows for the following url styles to work:

    my.registry.com/davargs
    my.registry.com/davargs/0.0.1
    my.registry.com/davargs/0.0.2
    my.registry.com/davargs/latest
    my.registry.com/davargs/-/davargs-0.0.1.tgz
    my.registry.com/davargs/-/davargs-0.0.2.tgz



NGINX CONFIGURATION
-------------------

Since we are writing a bunch of `index.json` files, you need to setup `nginx` to front the filesytem to resolve things like:

    myregistry.com/foo
                    /index.json

Note also that we write `404.json` and the top-level `index.json` to the '-' directory under the root, in order to not
collide with packages that might have those names.

Here is the simple `nginx.config` that I use on my local mirror.

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;
        charset utf-8;
        root   /Users/davglass/registry/;
        index  index.json;

        #cache the crap out of the tarballs
        location ~* ^.+\.(?:tgz)$ {
            expires 30d;
            tcp_nodelay off;
            open_file_cache max=3000 inactive=120s;
            open_file_cache_valid 45s;
            open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
            open_file_cache_errors off;
        }

        #don't cache the main index
        location /-/index.json {
            expires -1;
        }

        #cache all json by modified time
        location / {
            expires modified +15m;
            try_files $uri $uri/-/index.json $uri/index.json $uri.json =404;
        }

        error_page  404              /-/404.json;
    }



The `try_files` here with `$uri` are to keep nginx from doing a 302 redirect without the trailing `/`

LOGIC
-----

First, no files are ever deleted. The reference to the tarball may be removed from the local `package.json` but
the tarball itself is not removed. This is to ensure that things like `npm shrinkwrap` continue to work.

Each download is verified against the `shasum` in the package.json. If the verification fails, the file is retried
up to 4 times. If it fails all of those, it is skipped and not stored locally.

Each `change` request will process the entire module, not just the change alone. This is to make sure that tags
and new versions are all in sync.

HOOKS
-----

If you provide `--hooks <path>`, the module at `path` will be `required`. It is expected to export an object
whose properties are hook functions. A hook function has the following signature:

```javascript
function(data, callback){ /* ... */ }
```

`data` is a blob of data corresponding to the current state. Usually it's a set of useful metadata about
the package currently being processed.

`this.options` is the result of [yargs](https://github.com/chevex/yargs) parsing the command-line options and/or
config file. You can use this to refer to any existing options, or to introduce your own.

`this.log` is `registry-static`'s instance of `davlog`.

Hook functions are called with the same context each time and for each hook. It's one context shared throughout
the whole process. You can use this to share data between invocations or different hooks.

The callback's signature is:

```javascript
function(error, shouldSave){ /* ... */ }
```

Where `shouldSave` is a boolean stating whether or not to actually perform the action that happens right
after the hook (usually writing something to disk). In most cases, you'll want to call the callback with
`callback(null, true)`. To prevent the action from happening, you can do `callback(null, false)`.

Note the `data` passed in is a *reference*, so modifications to it may have side effects. For example, modifying
`data.tarball` in the `tarball` callback will change the location of the tarball.

Please don't throw any errors inside a hook function. If an error occurs, pass it along as a first parameter to
the `callback`.

Here are the currently provided hooks:

* **`beforeAll`**: Called before any data is written, at the beginning of processing a change. If the callback is called with an error or `false`, no more processing will be done for this change, and no files will be written.
* **`afterAll`**: Called after all the data is written, at the end of processing a change. If there is no error, the callback parameters are ignored.
* **`globalIndexJson`**: Called before writing an update to the top-level `index.json`.
* **`indexJson`**: Called before writing a package's main `index.json`.
* **`versionJson`**: Called before writing the `index.json` for a particular package version.
* **`tarball`**: Called before downloading/verifying/writing a package tarball.
* **`afterTarball`**: Called after downloading/verifying/writing a package tarball. If there is no error, the callback parameters are ignored.
* **`startup`**: Called before doing anything else at start time.
* **`shasumCheck`**: Called in order to check the `sha1sum` of a tarball. Calling back with true implies the shasum passed. Default is in `lib/defaultShasumCheck.js`.

Some examples are included in the `examples` directory.

BLOB-STORES
-----------

By default, `registry-static` uses `fs-blob-store`, meaning all the metadata and tarballs are stored
on disk, wherever you've decided to with the `--dir` option. Alternatively, you can use a custom
blob store, as long as it implements the [abstract-blob-store](https://github.com/maxogden/abstract-blob-store)
spec. Just create a file that exports the blob store you want, and then pass that in to the `--blobstore` option.

LOGGING
-------

Supports `--log <path>` to log all output to a specific file.

When doing this, you may want to rotate your logs. You can do this by sending the 
process a `SIGPIPE` signal. This will free up the file descriptor and then reattach it to the file.

If you are using logrotate.d, configure your process monitor to start `registry-static` like this:

`registry-static -d my.registry.com -o /var/www/ --log /var/log/registry-static/output.log`


and the logrotate config file (/etc/logrotate.d/registry-static):

    /var/log/registry-static/*.log {
            daily
            missingok
            rotate 52
            compress
            delaycompress
            notifempty
            sharedscripts
            postrotate
                    [ -f /tmp/registry-static.pid ] && kill -PIPE `cat /tmp/registry-static.pid`
            endscript
    }

(This assumes that your process monitor stores the pid in `/tmp/registry-static.pid`.)

CAVEATS
-------

Smart routes like `/-/all` or `/-/short`

These routes require processing of the files. You "could" technically do it with a cache and using the `fs` module
to walk the tree and build those routes.
